**Product:** [learn.significanthobbies.com](https://learn.significanthobbies.com)


A comprehensive interview preparation platform for mastering DSA, Low-Level Design, System Design, and Behavioral interviews.

## Current qualification and tasks

The drill journey now has [executable grading/persistence evidence](docs/knowledge/exercise-persistence-qualification.md),
including reload and two repaired editor-resume regressions. Source and CI
checks do not qualify hosted account persistence.

- [#97 — live exercise/account qualification](https://github.com/Significant-Hobbies/swe-interview-prep/issues/97):
  awaits approved deployment and a fresh guest/account browser journey.
- [#98 — retain unsynced local edits](https://github.com/Significant-Hobbies/swe-interview-prep/issues/98):
  remote reconciliation still needs an account-aware pending-write contract.

The task reconciliation found no prior open Issues or PRs; no historical
product intention was closed as complete.

## Problem

Technical interview preparation is fragmented across multiple tools: LeetCode for coding, Excalidraw for diagrams, ChatGPT for hints, and Anki for spaced repetition. Switching between tools breaks flow and makes it hard to track progress holistically.

SWE Interview Prep consolidates everything into a single platform with integrated code execution, diagram drawing, AI assistance, and spaced repetition review.

## Deployment & External Services

| Concern | Service |
|---------|---------|
| Hosting | Cloudflare Pages (`swe-interview-prep`) + Pages Functions backend (`functions/api/[[path]].js`) |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 |
| Auth | Google One Tap (JWT cookie) |
| File storage | Cloudflare R2 (`swe-interview-prep-assets`) — hosts the Go WASM interpreter |
| Analytics | PostHog (via `local posthog-js wrapper`) |
| AI | Vercel AI SDK via `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` against a BYO OpenAI-compatible endpoint (per-request `aiConfig` or `AI_*` env). Dev bridge streams local claude/codex/gemini CLIs. |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions — `ci.yml` on push/PR; `deploy.yml` is manual (`workflow_dispatch`) |

## Features

- **Interactive Code Editor** - Write and run TypeScript (transpiled and executed in-browser via sucrase) or Go (client-side WASM interpreter, with an `/api/go-run` → go.dev fallback) in Monaco Editor (VS Code engine)
- **Visual Design Tool** - Draw system architecture diagrams with Excalidraw integration
- **BYO-Endpoint AI Hints** - Get Socratic guidance without spoilers through any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (dev: local claude/codex/gemini CLIs)
- **Spaced Repetition System** - Concept mastery via FSRS (`ts-fsrs`); Anki decks can be imported
- **LeetCode Import** - Fetch problems directly via LeetCode API
- **Progress Tracking** - Monitor mastery across 18 learning tracks spanning interview fundamentals, systems, AI-native engineering, developer tools, applications, and multimodal computing
- **Pattern-Based Learning** - Group problems by algorithmic patterns (sliding window, two pointers, etc.)

**Key Components:**

- **Frontend**: React 19 SPA with TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor for code, Excalidraw for diagrams
- **Dev AI bridge**: in-process Vite plugin (`vite-plugin-local-ai.js`) streams the claude/codex/gemini CLIs at `/api/chat` so local dev needs no API keys; ships nothing to prod
- **Backend**: The production Cloudflare Pages Function (`functions/api/[[path]].js`) serves auth, `/api/progress`, the consolidated `/api/learning?action=…` surface, the Reader adapter, and the `/api/ai` catalog. AI generation uses an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; `/api/chat` and `/api/go-run` are dev/legacy handlers not deployed by the Pages Function
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 stores user progress, notes, FSRS concept mastery (`concept_mastery`), and imported problems through the Pages `DB` binding
- **Auth**: Google One Tap posts credentials to `/api/auth/google`; the server issues an httpOnly JWT cookie
- **External Integrations**: LeetCode API for problem import, multiple AI providers for hints

## Run Steps

### Prerequisites

- Node.js: `.nvmrc` pins `20.18.0`; CI/deploy run on Node 22 (either works, 20.18.0 is the floor)
- pnpm
- Cloudflare account for production deploys
- Cloudflare D1 database for production runtime data

### Setup

1. **Clone and install**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Significant-Hobbies/swe-interview-prep.git
   cd swe-interview-prep
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```

   Required build-time value:
   ```bash
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
   ```

   Required runtime values for Cloudflare Pages Functions:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

   D1 is a Pages binding, not an environment secret. For an isolated local
   database, run `pnpm db:migrate:local` and `pnpm dev:pages`.

   Optional AI/provider values can be supplied through the UI per request or via server env fallbacks such as `AI_ENDPOINT_URL`, `AI_API_KEY`, and `AI_MODEL`.

3. **Validate local env**
   ```bash
   pnpm validate:env:build
   pnpm validate:env:runtime
   ```

4. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

   Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. The dev AI bridge runs in-process (no separate server); `/api/chat` streams your logged-in claude/codex/gemini CLIs.

### Production Build

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```

Production deploys through Cloudflare Pages:

```bash
pnpm deploy
```

The deploy path validates env, builds `dist/`, and runs `wrangler pages deploy dist/ --project-name=swe-interview-prep`. Deploys are manual: the `deploy.yml` GitHub Action is `workflow_dispatch`-only (no push-to-`main` auto-deploy). `pnpm ready` / `validate:env:deploy` gate the deploy on env + tests + build.
